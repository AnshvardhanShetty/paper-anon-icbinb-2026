# Full deployed pipeline, transition accuracy (relaxed (10% maint error tolerance))

Per-window probabilities (`per_window_probas.parquet`) passed through the full deployed runtime pipeline (EMA → argmax → stability → cooldown → hysteresis → confidence floor), exactly as in `runtime/run_deploy.py:_apply_stability + _smooth_proba`, with parameters from `runtime/assist_profile.py` for each of the five assist levels.

Common: reaction buffer = 10 win (500 ms), maint cap = 110 win (5500 ms), maint error tolerance = 10%.

★ = deployed default (`runtime/run_deploy.py --assist-level 3`).

## Caveats

- Adaptive gain (per-channel signal-strength threshold scaling, `_apply_adaptive_gain`) is not replayed offline because we don't have the gain history. In live deployment, weak-signal patients (e.g. severely impaired) get hysteresis thresholds scaled by 0.4-0.7×, which would make transitions *easier* to accept and likely raise these numbers. The values here are therefore a slight under-estimate of true deployed transition accuracy on the most-impaired sub-cohort.
- Adaptive confidence floor reductions (same source) are similarly not replayed.
- All 5 profiles are evaluated; the deployed default in `run_deploy.py` is **Level 3** (Moderate Assist).
