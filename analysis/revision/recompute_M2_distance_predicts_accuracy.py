"""
Revision, M2: does the M1 distance predict per-patient cross-arm accuracy drop?

Post-hoc analysis (no HGB fits). Merges:
  - M1's per-patient d_within (own-hlth ↔ own-imp W₁) and d_across (own-imp ↔ others)
  - Cross-arm same-patient's per-patient cross-arm PO accuracy and impaired-arm own cal accuracy

Computes per-patient "gap" (own_cal_acc − cross_arm_po_acc), then correlates with:
  - d_within (bigger within-patient shift → larger cross-arm drop expected)
  - d_within − d_across (bigger relative within-patient shift → larger drop)

Decision (pre-registered): ρ > 0.3 with p < 0.05 converts observation to mechanism.
