"""
Per-dataset adapters: channel selection + gesture-to-3-class mapping.

Each EMGBench dataset has its own channel count, electrode geometry, and
gesture vocabulary. This module centralizes the dataset-specific decisions
so the main runner stays generic.

CHANNEL SELECTION RATIONALE:
  We map every dataset to a canonical 4-channel layout indexed as [0, 4, 9, 13]
  (matching hgb_adapted_model.pkl's channel_map). The actual dataset
  channel indices are chosen to approximate flexor digitorum + extensor
  digitorum positions on the forearm. Where the dataset lacks anatomical
  labels we use evenly-spaced positions around the forearm grid as a
  conservative default. SURFACED AS A DECISION, verify against per-dataset
  electrode layout figures before locking in.

GESTURE MAPPING RATIONALE:
  Same principle as ml/build_intent_dataset.py applied to GrabMyo:
    - Flexor-dominant grip gestures (fist, pinch, lateral) → close
    - Any finger-extension gesture (single or multi) → open
    - Rest → rest
    - Wrist flexion/extension, forearm rotation, idiosyncratic gestures → drop
  Per-dataset maps below; gestures not in the map are dropped.
