"""
Clinical-outcome translation of the deployed-pipeline transition accuracy.

Raw accuracy numbers don't speak to clinical relevance. This script translates
the deployed pipeline's behaviour into three clinically-meaningful metrics
that a rehab clinician would care about:

  1. **Per-rep success rate**, of N intended grasps in a session, what fraction
     does the system correctly recognise and *sustain* the motor command for?
  2. **False-activation rate during rest**, during patient rest, how often
     does the system incorrectly issue a close/open command? Reported as
     events per minute of rest.
  3. **Time-to-correct-command**, from cue/transition onset, how long until
     the first correct sustained prediction? (Latency-to-action.)

All metrics computed on the existing per-window predictions parquet, after
applying the deployed N=3 stability filter (Stage 2, Level 3 default profile).
