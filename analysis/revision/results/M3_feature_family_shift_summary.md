## Interpretation

- If amplitude-family features dominate both the shift ranking AND the deployment
  top-30 (from the feature audit), then the deployed signal path is exactly where
  the healthy→stroke distribution shift is largest.
- If crossing/frequency families dominate the shift, they're irrelevant at 20 Hz
  deployment because they're already dead there (F ≈ 2 in the feature audit).
- Ties into the K=30 finding: the features that matter at deployment are the same
  features whose distribution differs most.
