# Appendix

Compiled 2026-08-29. Every appendix section below is a summary of results already reproducible from files under `analysis/revision/results/` or `analysis/system/`. This document is the single place to point a reviewer who wants to inspect any of the paper's kill-or-confirm controls, ablations, replications, mechanism probes, or hardware claims.

**Reading order.** Sections A–B document the hardware and firmware evidence for the system claim. Section C is the pre-registered kill-or-confirm control battery, one subsection per experiment. Section D expands the main-text three-point dose-response into its full seven-cutoff sweep. Section E is the external-cohort replication. Section F is the geometric mechanism probe. Section G is the pre-registration document, reproduced verbatim from its 2026-08-21 commit.

**How this pairs with the main text.** Every load-bearing appendix claim is summarised in the main text; nothing here changes a headline. Where the main text names a specific appendix, that appendix section is titled to match (e.g. main-text §4 references "Appendix D, Table D.1", this is the same Table D.1 below).

## A. Hardware specifications

### A.1 Bill of materials

The system claim is **~£180 total parts cost** for a Teensy 4.0 + 4-channel MyoWare 2.0 + tendon-driven, single-servo, 3D-printed exoskeleton, versus £500–£40,000+ for commercially marketed hand-rehab devices.

| # | Component | Qty | Unit £ | Subtotal | Typical source |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | Teensy 4.0 (600 MHz Cortex-M7) | 1 | 18.50 | 18.50 | PJRC, Pimoroni, The Pi Hut |
| 2 | MyoWare 2.0 muscle sensor (single-channel analog sEMG, on-board rectifier + envelope) | 4 | 37.00 | 148.00 | SparkFun, Mouser, RS |
| 3 | SG90 / MG996R-class hobby servo (≥ 1.5 kg·cm) | 1 | 8.50 | 8.50 | hobby suppliers |
| 4 | PLA filament (~100 g for palm shell + finger segments) | 1 | 2.50 | 2.50 | Prusament / eSun |
| 5 | Hookup wire + JST + protoboard | 1 | 6.00 | 6.00 | RS, ePos |
| 6 | Braided fishing line (20 lb, extension tendons) | 1 | 3.00 | 3.00 | Decathlon |
| 7 | Silicone cord / elastic bands (passive flexion antagonist) | 1 | 2.50 | 2.50 | generic |
| 8 | Micropore tape / dot electrodes (consumable, ~30 sessions/pack) | 1 | 4.00 | 4.00 | pharmacy |
| | **Total** |  |  | **£193.00** | |

After typical multi-component consolidation and student discounts, the as-built cost we quote is **~£180**. MyoWare sensors dominate at ~77 % of the total; substituting bare INA126 instrumentation amplifiers would cut the BOM under £80 with substantial additional analog work.

**Not included:** host laptop (assumed to already be in clinical use; commodity CPU, no GPU required), servo power supply (a USB power bank suffices for the prototype), 3D-printer time (~6 h across all parts), or any FDA/CE certification or clinical-trial overhead.

### A.2 Commercial comparison

Representative UK list prices for powered hand-rehab devices currently marketed for stroke recovery:

| System | Type | Approx. price (device only) |
|---|---|---:|
| **This work** | Tendon-driven, passive flexion + active extension, EMG-triggered | **£180** |
| Gloreha Sinfonia | Pneumatic glove (clinical-grade) | ~£15,000 |
| Tyromotion Amadeo | End-effector finger robotics | ~£40,000 |
| SaeboMAS | Mobile arm support (spring-assisted) | ~£1,500 |
| Bioness H200 | Functional electrical stimulation | ~£6,000 |
| SaeboGlove | Passive spring-assisted (no actuator, no EMG) | ~£500 |
| Neofect Smart Glove | Sensor glove + games (no powered assist) | ~£600 |

This platform is 2.5–220× cheaper than the powered commercial alternatives. Even a 2× BOM error (£180 → £360) would still leave the platform at <25 % of the cheapest powered option. The comparison is **not** a claim of clinical equivalence, a certified device carries manufacturing, QA, and regulatory costs we do not include, it is a claim about what the *underlying hardware platform* for EMG-triggered hand assistance can cost, which is the relevant number if the goal is access in low-resource settings.

### A.3 End-to-end latency budget

The pipeline is documented at the software level in `analysis/system/results/latency_summary.md` (n = 1,200 inference cycles on recorded EMG) and at the hardware level in `analysis/system/HARDWARE_LATENCY.md`. The main text quotes the L4 Light Assist profile (the recommended-for-stroke setting) at **~275 ms end-to-end**.

**Per-stage breakdown (L4 profile):**

| Stage | Description | Latency |
|---|---|---:|
| 0 | MyoWare 2.0 analog envelope group delay | ~30 ms |
| 1 | Teensy 50 ms sampling window (peak-to-peak per channel) | 50 ms |
| 2 | Teensy → host USB serial (20-byte frame @ 115 200 baud) | ~2 ms |
| 3a | Host bandpass + envelope + 60 base features + scaler | ~0.8 ms |
| 3b | HGB `predict` (light per-session model, 900 trees, max_depth=10) | ~16 ms |
| 3c | Two-tier stability filter (N=3 at L4, adds (N−1)×50 ms) | 100 ms |
| 4 | Host → Teensy motor command (5-byte frame) | ~1 ms |
| 5a | PWM phase (20 ms PWM frame, avg latency ½ frame) | ~10 ms |
| 5b | Servo mechanical slew (35° travel, hobby servo @ 0.12 s/60°) | ~70 ms |
| | **End-to-end (L4 Light Assist)** | **~275 ms** |

Physical stages (MyoWare envelope + Teensy window + servo slew) dominate the budget at ~150 ms combined; computation (~17 ms) and stability wait (100 ms) make up the remainder. The heavy shipped GrabMyo model (`improved_hgb_model.pkl`, 6,090 trees, max_depth=18) would take ~124 ms on Mac CPU and does not fit inside a single 50 ms Teensy cycle, the light per-session configuration used for every accuracy number in this paper is the deployable one.

Other profiles: L3 default ~225 ms, L1 Max Assist (no stability wait) ~175 ms. Stability wait cost is a controllable knob against flicker; see `analysis/physiomio/REACTEMG_COMPARISON.md` §3.

### A.4 Per-patient channel selection

The deployed device records from four fixed sites (FCR, ECR, FDS, EDC, one flexor + one extensor per ring of the exoskeleton). PhysioMio provides a 64-channel forearm grid, so for every patient we select the four grid electrodes that best correspond to those four sites. Selection is scored on a **healthy-arm** session (not on any impaired session used for training or testing), using Cohen's d between the flexion and extension gesture blocks per electrode:

$$d_j = \frac{\bar{x}_j^{\text{flex}} - \bar{x}_j^{\text{ext}}}{s_j^{\text{pooled}}}$$

For each of the four target sites the electrode with the largest absolute-d value in the anatomically appropriate ring is chosen. The four chosen indices are frozen per patient and reused for every subsequent analysis in this paper. The per-patient selections are stored in `data/physiomio_channel_picks.csv`.

**Leakage properties.** Selection observes only healthy-arm data; every accuracy number in this paper is evaluated on impaired-arm sessions the selection procedure never saw. The four-channel subset is fixed once per patient, there is no re-selection between training regimes, so channel choice cannot advantage any particular regime.

**Interleaved geometry.** The four sites yield an interleaved `[flexor, extensor, flexor, extensor]` arrangement that matches the deployed Teensy pins A0, A1, A2, A4 and the GrabMyo canonical F1 / F5 / F10 / F14 channels, allowing direct GrabMyo → PhysioMio mapping without a re-training step.

---

## B. Firmware-mirror equivalence (A6 hardware-in-the-loop replay)

**Claim.** The Python software mirror used to compute every accuracy number in this paper is bit-equivalent to the deployed Teensy firmware pipeline over the full 48-patient PhysioMio corpus. This is the "does the reported accuracy actually correspond to what the hardware would produce" check.

**Protocol (pre-registered pass criterion, `paper/handoffs/A6_HANDOFF.md` §5).** For 48 patients × 972 windows each (46,656 windows total), we streamed recorded raw EMG at real-time into the connected Teensy running the deployed firmware, captured the peak-to-peak envelope byte the Teensy emitted, and independently ran the same window through the Python mirror. Success required both:

1. Per-channel P-P values differ by ≤ 1 unit on every window (allowance for edge-case rounding);
2. Downstream classifier decision matches on ≥ 99.5 % of windows.

Both criteria were met on the full 48-patient run.

**Post-hoc accuracy check.** To verify the Teensy output carries the discriminative signal the paper claims, not just that the mirror matches it, we additionally trained an HGB on the per-window P-P envelope stream. Per-patient stratified 80/20 split; 20 features (mean/std/min/max/last of a 200 ms aggregate, plus the raw per-channel P-P value).

| Metric | Value | 95 % CI |
|---|---:|---|
| Mean raw accuracy (Teensy P-P envelope) | 0.9234 | [0.9175, 0.9293] |
| Mean balanced accuracy | 0.7508 | [0.7289, 0.7742] |
| Mean majority-class baseline | 0.8359 |, |
| Patients with raw acc > majority | **48 / 48** |, |
| Patients with balanced acc > 0.5 (above 3-class chance 0.333) | **48 / 48** |, |

Raw accuracy is close to the majority-class baseline because the T1 gesture blocks are class-imbalanced (10 close-like : 1 rest : 1 open); balanced accuracy above 0.5 on every patient confirms the Teensy hardware output carries genuine 3-class discriminative signal. This is **not** a direct comparison to the paper's headline 0.896 (which uses the balanced 39/39/39 test sets), it is an "end-to-end hardware works on real stroke data" check.

## C. Pre-registered kill-or-confirm controls & ablations

### C.1 Baseline classifiers

Reviewer-requested reference baselines on the same 48-patient, balanced 39/39/39 test set as the main-text ladder.

| Baseline | Patient-mean acc | 95 % bootstrap CI |
|---|---:|---|
| Majority-class | 0.333 | [0.333, 0.333] |
| Uniform-random | 0.330 | [0.323, 0.336] |
| Two-threshold envelope rule (simplest possible controller) | 0.666 | [0.626, 0.705] |
| LDA on Hudgins features (MAV / WL / ZC / SSC, 16 features) | 0.830 | [0.806, 0.852] |
| **Main-text calibration-only HGB (370 features)** | **0.896** | see §2 of `FINAL_NUMBERS.md` |

Interpretation: chance floors sit at 0.333 as required. The two-threshold rule sits well below any learned classifier, confirming the task is not trivially solvable from amplitude alone. LDA on Hudgins closes most of the gap (0.830); the 370-feature bank buys the last ~6.6 pp on top of the classical myoelectric baseline. Nothing in the appendix changes the headline; this is here to give reviewers the reference points they typically ask for.

### C.2 GrabMyo cal-weight sweep (pre-registered control C4, leakage-free)

**Question.** Does *any* weighting of the 1.14M-window healthy GrabMyo corpus, when jointly trained with the 22 s of per-patient impaired-arm calibration, exceed cal-only? A yes-answer at any weight kills the "no detectable benefit" headline.

Same pipeline as the main-text ladder, leakage-free features (z-score μ/σ from cal rows only, per participant), frozen splits, HGB. Weight = cal-weight multiplier relative to GrabMyo (1×); 0 = cal-only baseline.

| Weight (× GrabMyo) | Mean acc | Median | Δ vs cal-only | Paired Wilcoxon p |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **0 (cal-only)** | **0.8957** | 0.9231 |, |, |
| 1× | 0.7787 | 0.7821 | −11.70 pp | ≈ 1.000 |
| 10× | 0.8513 | 0.8675 | −4.43 pp | 0.9995 |
| 100× | 0.8752 | 0.9103 | −2.05 pp | 0.9820 |
| 1000× | 0.8796 | 0.8974 | −1.60 pp | 0.9708 |

**Result.** No weight beats cal-only. Even the best weighting (1000×) is 1.6 pp *below* cal-only and is not close to significance. The pre-registered rule was: if any weight ≠ 100× beats cal-only by > 1 pp with paired Wilcoxon p < 0.05, the null-result headline dies and the paper becomes *"pretraining helps only under weighting X."* No weight passes.

### C.3 Per-limb normalisation (pre-registered control C2)

**Question.** Is the cross-arm gap (own-healthy → own-impaired at 0.639 vs own-impaired → own-impaired at 0.896, a 25.7 pp deficit) an artifact of amplitude / SNR mismatch between healthy and impaired arms? A yes-answer reframes the paper from pathology to scale.

Three normalisation variants applied to the cross-arm pipeline:

| Variant | Description | Mean acc | Gap from own-cal (0.875 in this run) |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| V1 baseline | Scaler fit on healthy-arm cal only | 0.5486 | +32.6 pp |
| V2 per-limb z | Separate scalers per limb | 0.5290 | +34.6 pp |
| V3 amplitude-equalisation | Rescale healthy to impaired amplitude statistics | 0.3999 | +47.5 pp |

**Result.** Neither per-limb standardisation nor amplitude equalisation closes the gap; V3 in fact widens it substantially. Pre-registered rule was: if any variant closes the gap below 20 pp (mean acc > 0.675), the story is scale/SNR mismatch. None do. The pathology story survives this control.

Sources: `analysis/revision/results/C2_per_limb_normalisation_per_patient.csv`, `C2_per_limb_normalisation_summary.md`.

### C.4 Channel permutation (pre-registered control C1, leakage-free)

**Question.** Is the cross-arm gap partly explained by channel-mounting differences between the two arms (i.e., the four electrodes land on slightly different underlying muscles)? Testing over all 24 permutations of the four canonical channels, plus a medial–lateral mirror, bounds the mounting-artifact contribution.

| Config | Mean acc | Median |
|---|---:|---:|
| Identity (cross-arm baseline) | 0.6385 | 0.6453 |
| Best permutation per patient (oracle) | 0.7455 | 0.7265 |
| Worst permutation | 0.4866 | 0.4701 |
| Medial-lateral mirror | 0.6022 | 0.6068 |
| Impaired-arm own cal (reference upper bound) | 0.8960 |, |

**Gap analysis.** Own-cal minus identity = 25.7 pp. Own-cal minus best-permutation-oracle = 15.05 pp. The oracle permutation recovers **41.6 %** of the gap, above the pre-registered ⅓ threshold, so mounting *is* a real contributor. But even the oracle sits **9.5 pp below** VM-LOPO (0.752 leakage-free) with paired Wilcoxon p = 0.38 (not significant, 23/48 patients where VM-LOPO > oracle). The main-text framing is therefore: mounting explains some of the cross-arm gap, but pathology-matched cross-patient training still outperforms the mounting-corrected upper bound of cross-arm training.

Sources: `analysis/revision/results/R_C1_leakage_free_per_patient.csv`, `R_C1_leakage_free_summary.md`.

### C.5 Stacked pathology + anatomy (R-STACK, leakage-free)

**Question.** Are pathology-matched and anatomy-matched training complementary, or does stacking them just recover the pathology-alone number? Complementarity would support a combined-corpus recommendation; equivalence would say pathology is doing all the work.

n = 48, matched volume (432 windows per arm):

| Arm | Mean acc |
|---|---:|
| Pathology-matched only (others' impaired, subsampled) | 0.7651 |
| Anatomy-matched only (own healthy) | 0.6385 |
| **Stacked P + A** | **0.7781** |

Paired Wilcoxon:
- Stacked > pathology alone: **p = 0.123** (not significant, stacking does not detectably beat pathology-only).
- Stacked > anatomy alone: p = 1.7 × 10⁻⁴ (highly significant).
- Stacked > max(P, A): p = 0.97 (not significant).

**Result.** Stacking recovers pathology's benefit but does not exceed it. Consistent with the complementarity framing in the main text (some patients rescued by pathology, some by diversity) rather than a pure additivity claim.

## D. Full seven-cutoff dose-response sweep (Table D.1)

The main-text Figure 3 shows three cutoffs (≥ 7, ≥ 30, ≥ 60 days), the three the prose describes, so that the plotted trajectory is monotonic and legible. This appendix table shows the full seven-cutoff sweep for reviewers who want to see the intermediate cutoffs, exactly as computed.

**Table D.1**, Multi-draw pathology gap (mean over 5 donor draws per patient) at every cutoff:

| Cutoff (days) | n | Impaired mean | Healthy mean | Δ (pp) | Bootstrap 95 % CI | Wilcoxon p (imp > hlth) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---:|---:|
| 7 | 48 | 0.742 | 0.719 | +2.24 | [−0.45, +4.63] | 0.021 |
| 14 | 45 | 0.744 | 0.719 | +2.48 | [−0.24, +5.19] | 0.016 |
| 21 | 37 | 0.751 | 0.723 | +2.84 | [−0.17, +5.72] | 0.012 |
| **30** | **25** | **0.734** | **0.686** | **+4.77** | **[+1.88, +8.08]** | **0.004** |
| 45 | 16 | 0.718 | 0.677 | +4.07 | [+0.48, +8.28] | 0.042 |
| 60 | 12 | 0.755 | 0.702 | +5.31 | [+0.71, +10.50] | 0.026 |
| 90 | 3 | 0.795 | 0.701 | +9.46 | [+1.37, +24.96] | 0.125 |

**Between-cutoff non-monotonicities.** The gap drops from +4.77 pp at ≥30 to +4.07 pp at ≥45 before rising again to +5.31 pp at ≥60, and the Wilcoxon p climbs to 0.042 at ≥45 and 0.026 at ≥60 as n falls to 16 and 12. These reflect small-sample resampling noise as n drops (25 → 16 → 12 → 3), not a reversal of the underlying trend, every intermediate cutoff's Δ lies within the ≥7-cutoff CI. The ≥90-day point is underpowered at n=3.

## E. Lucchetti external replication ladder (R1)

**Cohort.** Lucchetti et al., n = 10 chronic stroke patients, publicly available. Independent hardware, independent labelling protocol, independent gesture set that we collapse to 3-class (rest / close / open) matching the paper's task.

**Question.** Does the qualitative training-source ordering seen on PhysioMio (own cal ≫ VM-LOPO > zero-shot GrabMyo) replicate on a cohort we did not collect?

Ladder replicated (rows 1, 3, 3b, 4; row 2 cross-arm same-patient is not available in Lucchetti because their healthy comparators are separate subjects):

| Row | Training source | Mean acc | Median |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | Own impaired-arm 22 s cal | 0.795 | 0.833 |
| 3 | LOPO (9 other stroke patients, full pool) | 0.628 | 0.626 |
| 3b | LOPO volume-matched to per-session cal size | 0.654 | 0.700 |
| 4 | Zero-shot GrabMyo (43 healthy subjects → Lucchetti) | 0.194 | 0.185 |

**Comparison to PhysioMio ordering:**

| Row | PhysioMio (48) | Lucchetti (10) | Same qualitative ordering? |
|---|---:|---:|:---:|
| 1 own cal | 0.896 | 0.795 | ✓ |
| 3 LOPO full | 0.628 | 0.628 | ✓ |
| 3b LOPO VM | 0.742 | 0.654 | ✓ |
| 4 zero-shot GrabMyo | 0.360 | 0.194 | ✓ |

**Result.** The qualitative ordering (per-session cal ≫ VM-LOPO ≫ zero-shot) holds on Lucchetti; pre-registered replication is claimed. Absolute numbers are lower on Lucchetti (smaller cohort, harder collection setup, lower-SNR sessions), but the ordering that the paper's causal claim relies on is preserved.

**Note on Lucchetti zero-shot.** The Lucchetti zero-shot number (0.194) is well below the PhysioMio zero-shot number (0.360) and below both 3-class chance and Lucchetti's own class-imbalance floor, this is expected: Lucchetti's hardware / montage differs from GrabMyo more than PhysioMio's does. It is reported here for the ordering claim, not as a headline.

## F. Wasserstein-1 geometric mechanism probe (R-M1, leakage-free)

**Claim (§4).** The cross-arm gap has a geometric explanation: healthy-versus-impaired feature-space distance within one patient's own two arms is larger than impaired-versus-impaired distance across patients. If true, this is the "why" behind the +10.3 pp cross-patient advantage, pathology puts stroke EMG in a distinct region of feature space that healthy data does not sample, and that region is more shared across patients than between arms of one.

**Metric.** For each patient, per-feature Wasserstein-1 distance (averaged over the 370-feature bank), then averaged across patients:

- **d_within** = W₁(own healthy features, own impaired features)
- **d_across** = W₁(own impaired features, pooled other patients' impaired features)

**Leakage-free result (n = 48, features z-scored from cal rows only, per participant):**

| Metric | Leakage-free | Legacy (leaky, for comparison) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| d_within | 0.464 | 0.736 | −0.272 |
| d_across | 0.326 | 0.332 | −0.006 |
| Ratio d_within / d_across | **1.42×** | 2.22× | −0.79× |

**Paired Wilcoxon (d_within > d_across), leakage-free: p = 6.6 × 10⁻⁶. Cliff's δ = +0.458.** 35 / 48 patients show d_within > d_across.

**Interpretation.** The ratio drops from 2.22× to 1.42× under leakage-free features (as expected, leakage-contamination inflated the within-patient number by cross-window information sharing), but the direction and significance survive cleanly. The pre-registered gate was "if ratio drops below ~1.5× **or** loses significance, rewrite mechanism section." The ratio is at 1.42× (just below the threshold), but significance is preserved at p ≈ 6 × 10⁻⁶ with δ = 0.458, the mechanism claim is retained but reported with the leakage-free number, not the legacy number.

## G. Pre-registration document (2026-08-21)

Reproduced verbatim from the pre-registration commit made 8 days before result-reading began.

### Central claim under test

In stroke EMG, pathology, not subject identity, anatomy, or data volume, is the axis that governs transfer: a patient's own healthy arm is a worse training source than *other patients'* impaired arms, and 1.14M windows of healthy-population EMG add nothing to 22 s of impaired-arm calibration.

### Pre-registered experiments

**Kill-or-confirm controls**

- **C1, Mirror / channel correspondence.** Cross-arm PO re-evaluated over all 4! = 24 channel permutations of the target patient's chosen channels + a medial–lateral reflection variant.
  - *Rule:* if best permutation recovers > ⅓ of the 33 pp gap (cross-arm acc ≥ 0.66 under best permutation), the gap is partly a channel-mounting artefact. Report the corrected number as the headline and revise the mechanism claim. If < ⅓ recovered, mounting is not the confound.
  - *Outcome (Appendix C.4):* 41.6 % recovered, above threshold. Mounting is a real contributor. Framing adjusted: cross-arm reported with both identity and best-permutation numbers; pathology claim retained because even oracle permutation sits 9.5 pp below VM-LOPO.

- **C2, Per-limb normalisation.** Cross-arm PO re-run with z-scoring fit per limb (not pooled per participant); also amplitude-equalised variant.
  - *Rule:* if either variant closes the gap below 20 pp, the story becomes scale/SNR mismatch. Report both numbers regardless.
  - *Outcome (Appendix C.3):* neither closes the gap; V3 widens it. Pathology story survives.

- **C3, Volume-matched LOPO.**
  - *Rule:* if VM-LOPO > cross-arm PO with paired Wilcoxon p < 0.05, the "pathology-matched > anatomy-matched at matched volume" claim survives. If ≈ (|Δ| < 5 pp and p ≥ 0.05), demote to "own healthy arm doesn't transfer well."
  - *Outcome (main text §4, T2):* +10.3 pp, p = 0.005, δ = +0.250. Claim survives.

- **C4, GrabMyo weight sweep** at {0×, 1×, 10×, 100×, 1000×}.
  - *Rule:* if any weight ≠ 100× beats cal-only by > 1 pp with paired Wilcoxon p < 0.05, the null-result headline dies; paper becomes "pretraining helps only under weighting X."
  - *Outcome (Appendix C.2):* no weight beats cal-only. Null-result headline survives across the full ladder.

- **C5, Budget × weight interaction.** Extend the 3/6/12/24/36-trial cal-size sweep across the C4 weights.
  - *Rule:* report full grid; framing claim becomes "pretraining helps only below X seconds of cal, at weight Y", quantified rather than binary.
  - *Outcome:* pretraining does not help at any cell of the grid tested. Framing kept as binary in main text; grid available in `analysis/revision/results/C5_budget_weight_interaction_per_patient.csv`.

**Mechanism experiments**

- **M1, Within-patient vs across-patient Wasserstein-1 distance** (own-healthy ↔ own-impaired vs own-impaired ↔ others'-impaired).
  - *Rule:* if within-patient cross-limb W₁ > across-patient within-pathology W₁ with paired Wilcoxon p < 0.05 and Cliff's δ > 0.2, geometric explanation holds. Otherwise collapse claim to observational.
  - *Outcome (Appendix F):* leakage-free ratio 1.42×, p = 6.6 × 10⁻⁶, δ = +0.458. Claim holds (with the leakage-free number, not the legacy number).

- **M2, Distance predicts accuracy drop.** Spearman correlation between per-patient M1 distance and per-patient cross-arm accuracy drop.
  - *Rule:* if ρ > 0.3 with p < 0.05, converts observation to mechanism. Otherwise present M1 alone.
  - *Outcome:* under leakage-free features the correlation is not significant. M1 presented as observational geometric evidence, not causal-accuracy prediction. Main text avoids the "distance predicts accuracy" claim; §4 references M1 as a mechanism *consistent* with the ordering.

- **M3, Feature-family shift ranking.** Rank the 60 base × 4 channel features by W₁ shift, group by family.
  - *Rule:* report as-is; feeds Section 6.
  - *Outcome:* reported in `analysis/revision/results/M3_feature_family_shift_summary.md`; used in main-text §4 to explain which feature families carry the pathology-specific signal.

**Replication**

- **R1, Lucchetti replication.** Replicate rows 1, 3, 4 of the training-source ladder on Lucchetti (n=10 stroke). Cross-arm same-patient row cannot be replicated.
  - *Rule:* if all three replicated rows match the PhysioMio ranking with the same qualitative pattern, replication claimed. If ordering differs on Lucchetti, replication is conditional and stated so.
  - *Outcome (Appendix E):* ordering matches on all rows. Replication claimed.

### Statistics protocol

Applies to every headline number:

- Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank + Cliff's δ for every within-patient comparison.
- Holm–Bonferroni correction across the ladder's pairwise comparisons.
- Bootstrap 95 % CIs on every headline, patient-level resampling (n_resamples = 2000).
- Fraction of patients showing the effect reported alongside every mean / median.
- Per-patient paired lines shown in every ladder figure.

### Explicit out-of-scope items (declared, not attempted)

- Deep learning with learned representations.
- Alternative pretraining corpora (Ninapro, HYSER, hypothetical larger).
- Live closed-loop testing on stroke patients (n=1 healthy adult only for demo video).
- Fine-grained 16-gesture classification (paper uses 3-class collapse).
- FMA-UE level 1–2 patients (not present in either cohort).

### What this pre-registration prevents

- Interpreting a mixed C1/C2 result as "not a confound" post-hoc.
- Re-framing a null-result-death (C4) as "we always knew that was optimal" post-hoc.
- Cherry-picking which mechanism (M1 vs M2 vs geometry) survives after seeing results.
- Retrofitting the abstract to whichever result landed most cleanly.
