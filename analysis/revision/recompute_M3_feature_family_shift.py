"""
Revision, M3: feature-family shift ranking.

Post-hoc analysis on existing feature_shift_ranked.csv + engineered feature list.
Groups the 370 features by base family (amplitude / envelope / spectral /
waveform-crossing / cross-channel / other), reports mean Wasserstein-1 shift
per family. Ties into the K=30 deployment finding: amplitude-family features
carry both the signal AND the shift.
