"""
R-M2, distance predicts cross-arm accuracy drop (leakage-free).

Post-hoc analysis on:
  - R-M1's leakage-free d_within, d_across
  - Leakage-free ladder's cross-arm PO acc and impaired-arm own-cal acc

For each patient:
  gap = own_cal_acc − cross_arm_po_acc

Correlate gap with d_within (should be positive: larger within-patient shift →
larger accuracy drop) and with (d_within − d_across).

Pre-registered decision: ρ > 0.3 with p < 0.05 upgrades observation to mechanism.
