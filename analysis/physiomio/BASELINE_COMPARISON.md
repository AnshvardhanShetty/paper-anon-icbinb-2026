# Baseline comparison, ablating the model and the prior

Two ablations on the per-session calibration protocol, both evaluated
**within session** (cal and test drawn from the same session, separated by
the per-gesture temporal split with a 3-window buffer):

1. **Model-class ablation**, HGB vs LDA, both with GrabMyo + cal.
2. **Prior ablation**, HGB with GrabMyo + cal vs HGB on cal data only.

> **Scope (read first).** Every number in this document is *within-session*:
> the test set comes from the same session the cal data came from. These
> ablations characterise what each component contributes to **same-session**
> accuracy. They say **nothing** about cross-session generalisation, which
> is what the deployed system actually faces and which is measured
> separately by the longitudinal eval (Stream 5). The cross-session
> patient-only run is in progress; until it lands, no claim about the
> GrabMyo prior's role in deployment is warranted.

## Configurations (PhysioMio, n = 48, 329 sessions)

All HGB configs: max_iter=300, max_depth=10, class_weight='balanced',
370 engineered features, balanced test set (39 rest + 39 close + 39 open).

| Method | Training data | Session mean acc | Per-class F1 (rest / close / open) | Fit time / session |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Zero-shot (no patient cal) | GrabMyo only | 0.214 | 0.008 / 0.042 / 0.318 | 0 s |
| **Patient-only HGB** | 432 cal windows, no GrabMyo | 0.870 | 0.970 / 0.853 / 0.753 | 3.1 s |
| HGB + GrabMyo + cal (main) | 1.14M GrabMyo (w=1) + cal (w=100×) | 0.871 | 0.982 / 0.842 / 0.762 | 206 s |
| LDA + GrabMyo + cal | Same training mix, LDA model | 0.727 |, | fast |

## What the ablations actually show (within-session)

**Model class matters.** LDA + GrabMyo + cal reaches only 0.727, **14 pp
below** HGB on the same training data. HGB's non-linear capacity is
load-bearing for the same-session decision boundary; a linear discriminant
on the same 370 features and same calibration is materially worse.

**The GrabMyo prior adds ≤0.2 pp to same-session accuracy.** Patient-only
HGB (0.870) ties HGB + GrabMyo + cal (0.871) to within 0.2 pp, paired delta
+0.002; 25/48 patients favour the GrabMyo version, 23/48 favour patient-only
, a chance-level split. This held on Lucchetti too (patient-only 0.848 vs
GrabMyo+cal 0.828; the prior was marginally *negative* there).

**Interpretation, and its limit.** Within a single session, HGB with
class-balancing is sample-efficient enough to fit the 3-class problem from
~432 cal windows directly; the GrabMyo prior contributes little to
same-session accuracy. This is consistent with two non-exclusive readings:
(a) the GrabMyo prior is genuinely marginal, or (b) the GrabMyo prior's
value is cross-session regularisation that a same-session test cannot
detect. **These cannot be distinguished within session.** The
longitudinal-patient-only run (Stream 5 with the prior removed) is the
experiment that adjudicates: if patient-only degrades faster across
sessions than GrabMyo+cal, reading (b) holds and the prior earns its keep
in deployment; if it degrades the same, reading (a) holds.

## Cal-size ablation (patient-only HGB, 12-patient subset)

| Cal duration | Windows / gesture | Session mean acc | F1 macro |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7.2 s | 12 | 0.836 | 0.820 |
| 14.4 s | 24 | 0.843 | 0.823 |
| **21.6 s** | **36** | **0.868** | **0.853** |
| 36 s (default) | 60 | 0.869 | 0.854 |
| 54 s | 90 | 0.869 | 0.854 |
| 72 s | 120 | 0.869 | 0.854 |

Same-session accuracy **saturates at ~22 s of cued cal data**; the 60 s
default is conservative. Clinically useful: the calibration session could be
shortened to ~22-30 s without measurable same-session accuracy loss. (Again
within-session, whether a shorter cal degrades faster across sessions is
untested.)

## Comparison to ReactEMG's pretraining gain, stated carefully

Wang et al. (2026) report a +9 pp gain from healthy pretraining (stroke-only
0.69 → pretrained+LoRA 0.78). Our within-session prior ablation shows a
+0.1 pp gain from GrabMyo. **This is not a like-for-like comparison**:
ReactEMG's numbers are over 5 distribution-shifted held-out test sets
(including cross-session drift), whereas ours is same-session. A fair
comparison to their pretraining gain requires our cross-session
(longitudinal) patient-only numbers, pending. The plausible mechanism for
any divergence is that a 8M-parameter transformer needs pretraining to learn
"what EMG looks like" from raw signal, whereas our 370 engineered features
encode that structure by construction, but we should not assert the
magnitude until the cross-session comparison exists.

## What this does and does not change

- **Does NOT change the central claim.** Zero-shot 0.21 → calibrated 0.87 is
  a real cross-population result; the zero-shot baseline is GrabMyo applied to
  PhysioMio with no patient data, which is the cross-population test. Patient-side
  calibration closing that gap is the claim, and it stands regardless of whether
  the GrabMyo prior is jointly used.
- **Adds two methods-section ablation notes.** (1) HGB beats LDA by 14 pp,   model class is load-bearing. (2) The GrabMyo prior adds ≤0.2 pp same-session;
  its cross-session role is under test.
- **Adds a deployment-protocol result.** Cal can be ~22 s, not 60 s.

## Open item

Cross-session patient-only longitudinal (Stream 5 with `--patient-only`,
running now). Resolves whether the GrabMyo prior is decoration or a
cross-session regulariser. Until then, the methods section should report
the within-session ablation factually and defer the prior's deployment
role to that result.
