"""
Revision, M4: pairwise feature-importance similarity across patients/sessions.

Post-hoc analysis on mechanism_at_scale_importance_vectors.parquet.
For each pair of sessions (calibrated model), compute Spearman ρ between
their feature-importance rankings. Low mean pairwise ρ → each session's model
depends on a different feature subset → per-patient/per-session specificity in
feature space.

Also computes the same for GrabMyo-only model as a control (should be highly
similar across sessions, since the model is the same).
